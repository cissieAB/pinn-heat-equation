# Solving 2D Heat Equation with PINN
This project is to solve a 2D heat equation with [PINN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics-informed_neural_networks).
 The math description and Python implementation is given by the [Jupyter script](./PhasmExampleHeatEquation.ipynb).
 It is one of the JLab EPSCI [PHASM](https://github.com/nathanwbrei/phasm) examples.

This stand-alone repo is created to test the libtorch C++ APIs without
 considering the compatibility to the other PHASM codebase.
 It can also be used as the backup of the main repo.

## Environment
The repo is tested on the JLab ifarm GPU node with below configurations.

```
glibc(ldd): 2.17
cmake: 3.21.1
gcc: 10.2.0
CUDA: 11.4
GPU: one Tesla T4 or one TitanRTX
cuDNN: 8.4.1
libtorch: 1.12.1 + Linux + LibTorch + C++/Java + cu11.3 + pre-cxx11abi
OS: CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
Kernel: Linux 3.10.0-1160.71.1.el7.x86_64
```

As I have no root control of the system, the library version problem is not well handled.
 `cxx11 ABI libtorch` should be used but failed with a low `glibc`
 (description [here](https://github.com/nathanwbrei/phasm/blob/gpu/farm_guide.md#notes)) problem.
 Then I use the `pre-cxx11 ABI libtorch` for now.

## Build the project

```bash
# add torch lib to path
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libtorch/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# build project
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/libtorch;/path/to/cuDNN" ..
make
```

### `libtorch` and `cuDNN` installation
[`cuDNN`](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download) and
 [`libtorch`](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
 can be accessed at the official sites.
 The packages I am using are given as below.

```bash
cudnn-linux-x86_64-8.4.1.50_cuda11.6-archive.tar.xz
libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-1.12.1+cu113.zip  # cxx11 ABI, not used
libtorch-shared-with-deps-1.12.0+cu113.zip  # Pre-cxx11 ABI, used in this repo
```

Unzip these packages and they will make up of your `/path/to/libtorch` and `/path/to/cuDNN`.
